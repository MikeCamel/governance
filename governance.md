# CCC-Attestation Governance

The following document outlines how the Attesation WG governance operates.

## CCC-Attestation

The CCC-Attestation project is a sandbox for developing software to improve
interoperability between different confidential computing environments.

At the moment of its creation, there is no code in this project, thus creating
a canvas for all interested parties to co-create.

## Leads

To ensure representation and neutrality, five co-leads facilitate this working
group. The specific rules for lead (s)election are laid out in the technical
charter. These leads are responsible for providing status updates to the CCC
TAC, as well as supporting the day-to-day activities of the group, such as
calling meetings, etc.

Any code project created within this organization will have a liaison: a
primary point of contact between that project and the CCC-Attestation leads.

### Lead Responsibilities

Responsibilities are primarily administrative, lightweight, and may rotate
between chairs by election or delegation. For example:
- Providing periodic reports to the TAC
- Keeping public minutes and maintaining the agenda
- Ensuring any work items are appropriately tracked in some agreed-upon fashion

## Election Process

Five lead seats are filled by nomination from the CCC TAC to create the
Bootstrap Committee. These seats are appointed for two years. A new selection
process can begin any time a Lead on the Bootstrap committee chooses to step
down, or if the TAC chooses to remove a Lead after at least three months of
that Lead's inactivity. Leads may delegate responsibilities to a stand-in
(e.g., during a period of leave).

Two years after the formation of the Bootstrap committee, two of the seats will
come up for general election. Any member of CCC-Attestation who has been active
consistently over the prior 12 months may run for a seat. The term length for
these seats will be two years. The electorate will be made up of all
contributing members during the prior 12 months.

One year later, the alternate three seats will come up for the general
election, under the same terms, membership body, and electorate.

## Evolving the Governance

This governance structure may be amended at any time by simple majority (3/5)
vote of the Leads, and with approval from the TAC.
